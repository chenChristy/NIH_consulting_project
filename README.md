# NIH_consulting_project

### Here is an overview of this project:

#### Client: 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) -The largest public funder of biomedical research in the world 
NIH granted $39 billion in 2019 for biomedical research and training

#### Situation:
Because of the indirect linkage in the original NIH data system, it is difficult to find out the relationship between funded investigators and the publications. SCOPUS system establishes the linkage between authors and publications, making it possible for our client to clarify the output of research funding and thereby make better decisions.

#### Key question: 
How to map investigators with unique PPID in NIH system with the authors of publications into SCOPUS database with SCOPUS internal ID? 

#### Tool Used:
R, Excel
